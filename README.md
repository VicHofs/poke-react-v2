## Why PWAs (Progressive Web Apps)?

[Click Here][website] to check it out!

<img alt="Pok√©Api" src="https://pokeapi.co/static/pokeapi_256.888baca4.png">

_All data is pulled from the Pok√©Api API._

Use the search bar to look up a Pok√©mon‚Äîthrough its name or Pok√©dex ID No.‚Äîand get its sprite, Pok√©Dex ID, type(s) and description.

There is support for multiple languages‚Äîspanning across different games‚Äîin Pok√©mon descriptions.

Dark mode toggles automatically depending on the user's system preferences, but can be manually set to a preferred state that will persist.
